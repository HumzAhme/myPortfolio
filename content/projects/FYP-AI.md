Developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline to extract and analyze insights from multimedia transcripts using state-of-the-art transformer models (RoBERTa, BERTopic) and spaCy for NER. Designed custom text chunking methods and implemented dynamic visualizations (word clouds, interactive dashboards) using Matplotlib and Streamlit. Resulted in real-time content monitoring and actionable intelligence generation for complex data sets.
