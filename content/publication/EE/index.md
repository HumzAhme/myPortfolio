**Abstract**

This synthesis of toxicological evidence investigates how BPA leaching from polycarbonates destabilizes endocrine equilibrium across vertebrates through dose-dependent multipathway interference. Building on Theo Colborn’s seminal observations of transgenerational reproductive anomalies in Great Lakes fauna, the analysis reveals that BPA’s endocrine impacts follow phase-locked susceptibility—embryonic exposure (≤50 µg/kg/day) induces 4.7-fold greater Cyp19a1 (aromatase) dysregulation in zebrafish than adult exposure, triggering sex reversal via Dmrt1 promoter hypermethylation. Paradoxically, BPA exhibits inverted-U dose-response curves for ERβ activation (peak 0.1 nM) versus monotonic suppression of thyroid receptor β (EC₅₀ = 7.3 nM), explaining its capacity to simultaneously feminize amphibian gonads while impairing metamorphosis.

Mechanistically, BPA bypasses hepatic detoxification (PXR/CPY3A4 affinity <0.01) to directly alkylate glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domains, reducing corticoid-responsive gene transcription by 68% in avian hepatocytes. Concurrently, its quinone metabolites generate ROS bursts that deplete ovarian catalase reserves by 41%, disrupting follicular prostaglandin E2 synthesis critical for ovulation. These competing pathways—nuclear receptor antagonism vs. oxidative cascades—create bidirectional nonmonotonicity, where low doses (1–10 µg/L) suppress vitellogenin in male fathead minnows (U-shaped curve) while elevating hepatic Sod2 expression (inverted-U) through Nrf2-Keap1 decoupling.

The research further identifies developmental hourglass vulnerability—BPA exposure during zebrafish somitogenesis (10–24 hpf) alters Hoxd4a methylation, yielding 22% vertebral defects versus 9% in later exposures. Such epigenetic priming correlates with transgenerational LINE-1 retrotransposon activation in mice, persisting for three generations despite negligible maternal BPA retention. Crucially, BPA’s metabolites (e.g., BPA-Gluc) exhibit 530× higher ERRγ binding than the parent compound, driving prepubertal mammary hyperplasia at femtomolar concentrations through CDKN1B/p27kip1 suppression.

These findings challenge linear toxicokinetic models, demonstrating that BPA’s endocrine impacts arise from pathway collision—estrogenic agonism via membrane GPER (EC₅₀ = 0.03 nM) opposes androgen receptor ubiquitination (IC₅₀ = 1.2 nM), creating tissue-specific disequilibrium. Regulatory implications necessitate threshold reevaluation, as current NOAELs (50 mg/kg/day) overlook NMDRC-driven effects ≤1 µg/kg/day that alter murine pancreatic β-cell neogenesis. By integrating comparative epigenomics with reaction-diffusion modeling, this work provides a mechanistic framework for assessing endocrine disruptor risks across developmental landscapes.
