**Abstract**

This empirical investigation examines the thermal dynamics of milk cooling in porcelain mugs under controlled ambient conditions, analyzing how environmental temperature gradients influence heat transfer rates. Building on Newton’s Law of Cooling, the study quantifies temporal temperature decay patterns across three ambient conditions (8°C, 24.5°C, 44.5°C) at constant humidity (28%), measuring time intervals required to reach a drinkable threshold of 75°C. Experimental results demonstrate an inverse relationship between ambient temperature and cooling duration, with cooling times of 180s, 249s, and 518s observed for 8°C, 24.5°C, and 44.5°C environments, respectively. Heat transfer rates exhibited exponential decay as the temperature differential (T(t)−Tenv T(t)−Tenv) diminished, aligning with the theoretical framework Q/Δt=A⋅h⋅(T(t)−Tenv) Q/Δt=A⋅h⋅(T(t)−Tenv).

The sharper decline in heat flux at lower ambient temperatures (8°C) underscores the role of entropy-driven thermal gradients in accelerating energy dissipation. These findings validate the nonlinear dependence of cooling efficiency on environmental conditions, with practical implications for food service industries requiring precise temperature management. By correlating material properties (porcelain’s thermal conductivity) and environmental variables, this work provides a predictive model for optimizing serving temperatures in hospitality settings, reducing reliance on trial-and-error methods. The study advances applied thermodynamics in culinary contexts while reaffirming classical heat transfer principles under real-world constraints.
