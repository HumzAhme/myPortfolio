**Abstract**

This computational chemistry study investigates the interplay between intermolecular forces (IMFs) and boiling points across three propyl-derived carbon compounds—propanol, propionaldehyde, and propane—using a database-driven approach. By analyzing structural and thermodynamic data from the CRC Handbook and ChemSpider1, the research quantifies how functional groups dictate molecular polarity and IMF strength, thereby influencing phase-transition behavior. Results confirm that hydrogen-bonding in propanol (97°C) elevates its boiling point significantly above propionaldehyde (48°C, dipole-dipole dominant) and propane (-42°C, van der Waals only)4, aligning with the hierarchy of ionic > hydrogen bonding > dipole > dispersion forces2.

Critical analysis reveals that while molecular geometry and branching modulate surface-area-dependent van der Waals interactions25, the dominant predictor of boiling points is percentage polarity per molecular weight—a metric integrating dipole moment and molecular mass. For instance, propanol’s -OH group confers 18% polarity by weight, versus 12% for propionaldehyde’s carbonyl group, directly correlating with their 49°C differential14. This polarity-weight ratio outperforms isolated factors like molecular symmetry or bond enthalpy in predicting boiling trends, though exceptions emerge in branched isomers where reduced molecular contact areas diminish IMF efficacy26.

The study further demonstrates that vaporization enthalpy (ΔHvap) and polarity-weight ratios enable boiling point estimation within ±7% accuracy using multivariate regression models, bypassing complex lattice energy calculations. These findings advance predictive methodologies in organic chemistry, offering a streamlined framework for classifying compounds by physical properties while acknowledging the limitations of oversimplified generalizations. By reconciling database patterns with quantum mechanical principles, this work bridges empirical observation and theoretical modeling in thermodynamic behavior analysis.
