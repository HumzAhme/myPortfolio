**Abstract**

This experimental study examines the mechanisms of informational conformity in decision-making under conditions of uncertainty. Building on foundational work by Jenness (1932) and Wooten & Reed (2008), the research investigates how individuals integrate social information when faced with ambiguous tasks. Participants (N = [sample size]) completed a perceptual estimation task involving ambiguous stimuli (e.g., bead-counting) under three conditions: exposure to confederates providing deliberately high estimates, low estimates, or no external input (control). Results demonstrated significant divergence in mean estimates across conditions, with participants in the high-confederate condition reporting substantially higher averages (854 beads) compared to both low-confederate (648 beads) and control groups (688 beads) (p < [value]). This disparity underscores the potent role of peer-generated numerical cues in shaping judgments during uncertainty, even when confederates lack overt authority.

Critically, the absence of compliance pressure—given confederates’ status as peer-level college students—suggests conformity arose through unconscious informational assimilation rather than deliberate social compliance. These findings align with dual-process models of persuasion, where peripheral cognitive processing mediates the integration of external cues in ambiguous contexts. The study advances understanding of conformity dynamics by isolating informational influence from normative pressures, reinforcing the predictive power of social information in uncertain environments. Theoretical implications for behavioral economics, crowd psychology, and decision-making models are discussed.
