**Abstract**

My travelling time for reaching school was something that made me contemplate over the traffic problems in not only my country but worldwide, actually at some places, people facing the music even more than what I had to face on daily basis.
Thus, I have made an attempt to explore and work on signal switching, in accordance with the traffic being heavy or light, at any part of the day, using mathematics in a rather simple and uncomplicated way.
I visited traffic departments to talk with the officials responsible for tracking and working with the daily traffic. I was given the data available at the departments, from which I observed and came across a few important factors that I thought could be worked on, like the usual road sizes, that is to say the number of lanes planned in my city, number of cars crossing and signal switching time etc.
I, thus decided to use a few simple variables (independent, dependent and controlled), to calculate the switching time that could be a solution to a smoother traffic flow.
